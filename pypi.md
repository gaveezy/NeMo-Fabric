![Diagram showing NeMo Fabric connecting applications, evaluations, and reinforcement learning rollouts to Hermes, Codex, Claude, and Deep Agents, with results, artifacts, and telemetry as outputs.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/refs/heads/main/assets/fabric-hero-option2.png)

NeMo Fabric gives users one configurable, observable way to run applications
across multiple agent harnesses. It standardizes configuration, lifecycle
management, and results without requiring a separate integration for every harness.

NeMo Fabric lets you change harnesses without rebuilding each integration,
isolate conflicting runtime dependencies, and manage harness configuration,
execution, and observability consistently. Every run returns normalized
results, artifacts, and telemetry for downstream systems to consume.

It provides:

- a versioned, typed configuration contract;
- ordinary Python composition for experiment variants;
- adapter integrations for harness-specific launch and control;
- a Python SDK backed by the Rust core;
- normalized run results, artifact manifests, and telemetry references.

## Install

Install the core runtime and Python SDK:

```bash
pip install nemo-fabric
```

### Supported Python Versions

NeMo Fabric supports Python 3.11 through 3.14. However some harnesses and
and integrations have more restrictive requirements. Hermes Agent requires
Python 3.11 through 3.13, and the Harbor integration requires Python 3.12 or later.


### Supported Harnesses

The following table shows the install target for each supported agent harness:

| Agent Harness | Runtime, Adapter, and Harness | Adapter and Harness | Adapter Only |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Claude Code](https://pypi.org/project/nemo-fabric-adapters-claude/) | `nemo-fabric[claude]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-claude[harness]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-claude` |
| [Claude Code CLI](https://pypi.org/project/nemo-fabric-adapters-claude-code-cli/) | `nemo-fabric[claude-code-cli]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-claude-code-cli[harness]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-claude-code-cli` |
| [Codex](https://pypi.org/project/nemo-fabric-adapters-codex/) | `nemo-fabric[codex]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-codex[harness]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-codex` |
| [Codex CLI](https://pypi.org/project/nemo-fabric-adapters-codex-cli/) | `nemo-fabric[codex-cli]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-codex-cli[harness]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-codex-cli` |
| [Hermes Agent](https://pypi.org/project/nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes/) | `nemo-fabric[hermes-agent]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes[harness]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes` |
| [LangChain Deep Agents](https://pypi.org/project/nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents/) | `nemo-fabric[deepagents]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents[harness]` | `nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents` |


To install the NeMo Fabric runtime, adapter, and supported harness in one
environment, choose one of the following `nemo-fabric` harness extras:

```bash
pip install "nemo-fabric[claude]"
pip install "nemo-fabric[claude-code-cli]"
pip install "nemo-fabric[codex]"
pip install "nemo-fabric[codex-cli]"
pip install "nemo-fabric[deepagents]"
pip install "nemo-fabric[hermes-agent]"
```

To install an adapter and its harness without the NeMo Fabric runtime, choose
one of the following adapter package `harness` extras:

```bash
pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-claude[harness]"
pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-codex[harness]"
pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents[harness]"
pip install "nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes[harness]"
```

Every adapter package also provides an adapter-scoped `full` extra, which does
not install the NeMo Fabric runtime. For Claude and Codex, `full` installs the
same dependencies as `harness`. For LangChain Deep Agents and Hermes Agent,
`full` also installs the NeMo Relay Python package. The Claude Code CLI and
Codex CLI adapters drive external executables, so their `harness` and `full`
extras install no additional packages.

If the environment already manages a compatible harness, choose one of the
following bare adapter packages:

```bash
pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-claude
pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-claude-code-cli
pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-codex
pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-codex-cli
pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-deepagents
pip install nemo-fabric-adapters-hermes
```

The adapter distribution contains only adapter-owned runtime dependencies. It
does not install the NeMo Fabric runtime. Select `harness` or `full` to install
the harness. If the runtime shares an environment with an existing compatible
harness, install `nemo-fabric` and the bare adapter package together.


### Integrations

#### Harbor Integration

```bash
pip install "nemo-fabric[harbor]"
```

#### NeMo Relay Integration

```bash
pip install "nemo-fabric[relay]"
```

This installs a version of the
[NeMo Relay Python package](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/relay) known to be
compatible with the installed version of NeMo Fabric.

The LangChain Deep Agents and Hermes Agent adapter packages also provide
`relay` and `full` extras for environments that do not install `nemo-fabric`.
Claude and Codex require the
[`nemo-relay` CLI](https://crates.io/crates/nemo-relay-cli) instead of the NeMo
Relay Python package. They do not provide a `relay` extra. Refer to the
[NeMo Relay CLI](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/fabric/getting-started/install#nemo-relay-cli)
install guide for instructions on installing the CLI tool.
