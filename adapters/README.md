# NVIDIA NeMo Fabric Agent Harness Adapters

NeMo Fabric adapters translate the normalized NeMo Fabric contract into
harness-native models, tools, sessions, and telemetry. Use this reference to
compare the bundled adapters and then open the linked package guide for
installation, authentication, and configuration details.

The adapter descriptor selected in `RunPlan` is authoritative for normalized
configuration, its adapter-owned settings schema, and telemetry support.

## Descriptor Discovery

As a stopgap until NeMo Fabric has a provider-backed adapter registry, the
Python SDK discovers descriptors in three locations. Later locations take
precedence:

1. descriptors bundled in the NeMo Fabric source repository;
2. `<sysconfig data>/share/nemo-fabric/adapters`, populated by adapter wheels
   and queried from `ADAPTER_PYTHON` when set, otherwise from the current Python;
3. `<base_dir>/adapters`, for agent-local and development overrides.

NeMo Fabric resolves multi-component relative `ADAPTER_PYTHON` paths from
`<base_dir>`. It resolves bare command names through `PATH`.

The winning descriptor supplies its runner metadata, `settings_schema`, and
optional `workflow_schema` atomically. Planning validates `harness.settings`
and `FabricConfig.workflow` against those exact schemas. An agent-local
descriptor therefore replaces installed schemas rather than merging with them.
Descriptor schemas must be self-contained; NeMo Fabric does not resolve HTTP or
file references from adapter descriptors.

This scan only discovers installed metadata. It is not the final registry
contract for resolving or installing third-party adapters. Installed and
agent-local descriptors both currently report `source: local`; a registry
provider should expose more precise provenance.

## Configuration Compatibility

| Agent Harness | Models | Tool Policy | MCP | Skills | Subagents |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Claude](claude/README.md) | Native Anthropic or a configured Anthropic Messages-compatible provider | `tools.enabled` selects built-ins; a pre-tool hook enforces enabled and blocked names across built-in, MCP, and plugin tools | Normalized: stdio, HTTP, streamable HTTP, and SSE | Normalized `skills.paths` | Not exposed |
| [Claude Code CLI](claude-code-cli/README.md) | Native Anthropic or a configured Anthropic Messages-compatible provider | `tools.blocked` maps to `--disallowed-tools`; `mcp_stdio` tool definitions become stdio MCP servers; `tools.enabled` unsupported | Normalized: stdio, HTTP, streamable HTTP, and SSE; no MCP authentication | Normalized `skills.paths` staged as a generated plugin | Not exposed |
| [Codex](codex/README.md) | Native OpenAI or a configured Responses-compatible provider | `tools.enabled` and `tools.blocked` unsupported | Normalized: stdio, HTTP, and streamable HTTP | Normalized `SKILL.md` directories | Not exposed |
| [Codex CLI](codex-cli/README.md) | Native OpenAI or a configured Responses-compatible provider | `tools.enabled` and `tools.blocked` unsupported | Normalized: stdio, HTTP, and streamable HTTP; no MCP authentication | Normalized `SKILL.md` directories linked into the workspace | Not exposed |
| [LangChain Deep Agents](deepagents/README.md) | LangChain model providers | Middleware enforces `tools.enabled` and `tools.blocked` across built-ins, MCP, and local delegation | Normalized through `langchain-mcp-adapters` | Normalized | Built-in, declarative, and Agent Protocol |
| [Hermes Agent](hermes/README.md) | Configurable provider, model, and base URL | `tools.enabled` and `tools.blocked` map to Hermes native toolset selectors | Normalized | Normalized | Not exposed |

"Normalized" means that the adapter accepts the corresponding `FabricConfig`
field. "Not exposed" does not mean that the underlying harness lacks the
feature; it means that NeMo Fabric does not provide a portable configuration
surface for it. Tool values are adapter-native selectors; NeMo Fabric does not
define a cross-harness tool-name catalog. Planning fails when the selected
adapter cannot enforce a configured policy. Deep Agents supports its built-in
subagent and descriptor-validated caller-defined subagents. A configured tools
policy permits only local declarative subagents because the adapter cannot gate
remote Agent Protocol tools.

`RunPlan.capability_plan.routes` records execution ownership, not network
routing. `harness_native` assigns a capability to the selected adapter,
`fabric_managed` assigns it to NeMo Fabric, and `unsupported` means neither can
execute it. Scalar fields are validated separately against
`adapter_descriptor.config.accepts`.

### Complete FabricConfig Support

`Core` means NeMo Fabric owns the behavior and applies it uniformly before or around
adapter execution. `Yes` means the adapter translates the normalized field into
its harness. `No` means an explicitly configured value fails planning instead
of being ignored. The following table groups provider-specific Relay subfields
and additive extension maps because their support does not vary by adapter:

The CLI adapters (`nvidia.fabric.claude.code.cli` and `nvidia.fabric.codex.cli`)
drive the `claude` and `codex` executables directly and match their SDK
counterparts' columns below, with two differences: Claude Code CLI does not
support `tools.enabled`, and it additionally supports `tools.definitions`
(kind `mcp_stdio`, exposed as stdio MCP servers). Neither CLI adapter supports
MCP `authentication`.

The selected model role is `default`, or the sole configured role when no
`default` exists. More than one role without `default` fails planning.
Claude and Codex publish a descriptor-owned `model_schema` for every configured
model role. Their native providers (`anthropic` and `openai`, respectively)
keep the existing authentication path. Other providers remain valid only with
an explicit `base_url` and `api_key_env`. The same schema rejects undeclared
`ModelConfig.settings` during planning and reports each issue through
`doctor(...)` before adapter startup.
`runtime.max_turns` is optional; omitting it preserves adapter-native defaults
without creating a compatibility requirement.

## Runtime and Observability Compatibility

All bundled adapters use one persistent Python adapter host with an ordered
`start` → `invoke*` → `stop` protocol.

NeMo Relay records raw events in Agent Trajectory Observability Format (ATOF)
and produces normalized trajectories in Agent Trajectory Interchange Format
(ATIF).

| Agent Harness | State Retained Across Turns | Relay Integration | Per-Turn Behavior | Stop Behavior | Remote Service |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Claude](claude/README.md) | `ClaudeSDKClient` and Claude session ID | Runtime-owned Relay CLI gateway and generated Claude hooks | Calls `client.query()`, validates the session ID, and collects ATOF and ATIF | Disconnects the client, stops the gateway, and removes the generated plugin | Not implemented |
| [Claude Code CLI](claude-code-cli/README.md) | Claude session ID | Runtime-owned Relay CLI gateway and generated Claude hook settings | Runs one headless `claude --print` turn and resumes the tracked session | Stops the gateway and removes the generated settings, MCP config, and skill plugin | Not implemented |
| [Codex](codex/README.md) | `AsyncCodex` app-server client and SDK thread | Runtime-owned Relay CLI gateway and Codex SDK hooks | Reuses the SDK thread and persists its thread ID | Closes the SDK client and app server, then stops the gateway | Not implemented |
| [Codex CLI](codex-cli/README.md) | Codex thread ID | Runtime-owned Relay CLI gateway and generated Codex profile hooks | Runs one `codex exec --json` turn and resumes the tracked thread | Stops the gateway and removes the generated profile and workspace skill links | Not implemented |
| [LangChain Deep Agents](deepagents/README.md) | Compiled LangGraph agent, checkpointer, and thread ID | NeMo Relay Python SDK integration added when the agent is compiled | Creates a fresh Relay request scope and callback for each invocation | Closes the checkpointer; no gateway process | Not implemented |
| [Hermes Agent](hermes/README.md) | `AIAgent`, `SessionDB`, and conversation history | Hermes Agent NeMo Relay plugin context | Finalizes and flushes Relay after each invocation | Closes the agent and database, then exits the plugin context | Not implemented |

Telemetry output names use the descriptor contract values. Claude, Claude Code
CLI, Codex, Codex CLI, and Hermes Agent can emit NeMo Relay ATIF,
OpenTelemetry, and OpenInference output. Deep Agents supports the same Relay
outputs plus native OpenTelemetry and OpenInference; Codex and Codex CLI also
support native OpenTelemetry.

Shared lifecycle, Relay gateway, hook, and payload helpers are documented in
the [adapter utilities guide](common/README.md).
